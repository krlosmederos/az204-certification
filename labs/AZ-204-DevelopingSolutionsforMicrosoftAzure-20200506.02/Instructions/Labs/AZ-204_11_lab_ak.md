# Lab: Asynchronously processing messages by using Azure Storage Queues
# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community brings needed changes to our attention; however, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

        await client.ReceiveMessagesAsync(batchSize, visibilityTimeout);
        ```

    1.  Update the previous line of code by adding more code to store the result of the expression in a new variable named *messages* of type **[Response<QueueMessage[]>](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.response-1)**:

        ```
        Response<QueueMessage[]> messages = await client.ReceiveMessagesAsync(batchSize, visibilityTimeout);
        ```

1.  Within the **Main** method, perform the following actions to iterate over and render the properties of each message:

    1.  Add the following line of code to create a **foreach** loop that iterates over each message that's stored in the **[Value](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.response-1.value)** property of the *messages* variable of type **[QueueMessage[]](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.models.queuemessage)**:

        ```
        foreach(QueueMessage message in messages?.Value)
        {
        }
        ```

    1.  Within the **foreach** loop, add another line of code to render the **MessageId** and **MessageText** properties of each **QueueMessage** instance:
    
        ```
        Console.WriteLine($"[{message.MessageId}]\t{message.MessageText}");
        ```

1.  Observe the **Main** method, which should now include:
