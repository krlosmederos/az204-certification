# Lab: Retrieving Azure Storage resources and metadata by using the Azure Storage SDK for .NET
# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community brings needed changes to our attention; however, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Blob Found:\t{blob.Name}");
    ```

1.  In the **GetBlobAsync** method, enter the following code to return the instance of the **BlobClient** class named **blob** as the result of the **GetBlobAsync** method:

    ```
    return blob;
    ```

1.  Observe the **GetBlobAsync** method, which should now include:

    ```
    private static async Task<BlobClient> GetBlobAsync(BlobContainerClient client, string blobName)
    {      
        BlobClient blob = client.GetBlobClient(blobName);
        await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Blob Found:\t{blob.Name}");
        return blob;
    }
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, enter the following code at the end of the method to create a variable named *uploadedBlobName* with a value of **graph.svg**:

    ```
    string uploadedBlobName = "graph.svg";
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, enter the following code at the end of the method to invoke the **GetBlobAsync** method, passing in the *containerClient* and *uploadedBlobName* variables as parameters, and to store the result in a variable named *blobClient* of type **BlobClient**:

    ```
    BlobClient blobClient = await GetBlobAsync(containerClient, uploadedBlobName);
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, enter the following code at the end of the method to render the **Uri** property of the *blobClient* variable:

    ```
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Blob Url:\t{blobClient.Uri}");
    ```

1.  Observe the **Main** method, which should now include:

    ```
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        \\ Existing code removed for brevity
        
        await EnumerateContainersAsync(serviceClient);

        string existingContainerName = "raster-graphics";
        await EnumerateBlobsAsync(serviceClient, existingContainerName);
        
        string newContainerName = "vector-graphics";
        BlobContainerClient containerClient = await GetContainerAsync(serviceClient, newContainerName);
        
        string uploadedBlobName = "graph.svg";
        BlobClient blobClient = await GetBlobAsync(containerClient, uploadedBlobName);

        await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Blob Url:\t{blobClient.Uri}");
    }
    ```

1.  Save the **Program.cs** file.

1.  In the **Visual Studio Code** window, right-click or activate the shortcut menu for the Explorer pane, and then select **Open in Terminal**.

1.  At the open command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to run the .NET web application:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    > **Note**: If there are any build errors, review the **Program.cs** file in the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\03\\Solution\\BlobManager** folder.

1.  Observe the output from the currently running console application. The updated output includes the final URL to access the blob online. Record the value of this URL to use later in the lab.

    > **Note**: The URL will likely be similar to the following string: **https://mediastor*[yourname]*.blob.core.windows.net/vector-graphics/graph.svg**

1.  Select **Kill Terminal** or the **Recycle Bin** icon to close the currently open terminal and any associated processes.

#### Task 5: Test the URI by using a browser

1.  On the taskbar, right-click the **Microsoft Edge** icon or activate the shortcut menu, and then select **New window**.

1.  In the new browser window, go to the URL that you copied for the blob earlier in this lab.

1.  You should now notice the Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) file in your browser window.

#### Review

In this exercise, you created containers and managed blobs by using the Storage SDK. 

### Exercise 5: Clean up your subscription 

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell and list resource groups

1.  In the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than sign (\>) and underscore character (\_).

1.  If this is your first time opening Cloud Shell using your subscription, you can use the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell Wizard** to configure Cloud Shell for first-time usage. Perform the following actions in the wizard:
    
    1.  A dialog box prompts you to create a new storage account to begin using the shell. Accept the default settings, and then select **Create storage**. 

    > **Note**: Wait for Cloud Shell to finish its initial setup procedures before moving forward with the lab. If you don't notice Cloud Shell configuration options, this is most likely because you're using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written with the presumption that you're using a new subscription.

1.  At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt in the portal, enter the following command, and then select Enter to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```
    az group list
    ```

1.  At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to get a list of possible commands to delete a resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --help
    ```

#### Task 2: Delete a resource group

1.  At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to delete the **StorageMedia** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name StorageMedia --no-wait --yes
    ```
    
1.  Close the Cloud Shell pane in the portal.

#### Task 3: Close the active application

1.     the currently running Microsoft Edge application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource group used in this lab.
