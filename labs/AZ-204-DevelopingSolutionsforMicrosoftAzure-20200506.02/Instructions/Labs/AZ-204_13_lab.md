# Lab: Enhancing a web application by using the Azure Content Delivery Network
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

Your marketing organization has been tasked with building a website landing page to host content about an upcoming edX course. While designing the website, your team decided that multimedia videos and image content would be the ideal way to convey your marketing message. The website is already completed and available using a Docker container, and your team also decided that it would like to use a content delivery network (CDN) to improve the performance of the images, the videos, and the website itself. You have been tasked with using Microsoft Azure Content Delivery Network to improve the performance of both standard and streamed content on the website.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Register a Microsoft.CDN resource provider.

-   Create Content Delivery Network resources.

-   Create and configure Content Delivery Network endpoints that are bound to various Azure services.

## Lab setup

-   Estimated time: **45 minutes**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab virtual machine

Ensure that you're signed in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:
    
-   Username: **Admin**

-   Password: **Pa55w.rd**

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icon for the application that you'll use in this lab:

-   Microsoft Edge

### Exercise 1: Create Azure resources

#### Task 1: Open the Azure portal

1.  Sign in to the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>).

1.  If this is your first time signing in to the Azure portal, you'll notice a dialog box offering a tour of the portal. Select **Get Started** to skip the tour.

#### Task 2: Create a Storage account

1.  Create a new storage account with the following details:
    
    -	New resource group: **MarketingContent**

    -	Name: **contenthost*[yourname]***

    -	Location: **East US**

    -	Performance: **Standard**

    -	Account kind: **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**

    -	Replication: **Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)**

    -	Access tier: **Hot**

    > **Note**: Wait for Azure to finish creating the storage account before you move forward with the lab. You'll receive a notification when the account is created.
   
#### Task 3: Create a web app by using Azure App Service

1.  Create a new web app with the following details:

    -   Existing resource group: **MarketingContent**
    
    -   Name: **landingpage*[yourname]***

    -   Publish: **Docker Container**

    -   Access type: **Public**

    -   Image and tag: **microsoftlearning/edx-html-landing-page:latest**
  
    > **Note**: Wait for Azure to finish creating the web app before you move forward with the lab. You'll receive a notification when the app is created.

1.  Access the **landingpage*[yourname]*** web app that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  In the **Settings** section, go to the **Properties** section, and then record the value of the **URL** text box. You'll use this value later in the lab.

#### Review

In this exercise, you created an Azure Storage account and an Azure Web App that you'll use later in this lab.

### Exercise 2: Configure Content Delivery Network and endpoints

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell

1.  Open a new Cloud Shell instance in the Azure portal.

1.  If Cloud Shell isn't already configured, configure the shell for Bash by using the default settings.

1.  At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt in the portal, use the **az** command with the **--version** flag to get the version of the Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI) tool.

#### Task 2: Register the Microsoft.CDN provider

1.  Use the **az** command with the **--help** flag to find a list of subgroups and commands at the root level of the Azure CLI.

1.  Use the **az provider** command with the **--help** flag to get a list of commands available for resource providers.

1.  Use the **az provider list** command to list all currently registered providers.

1.  Use the **az provider list** command again with the **--query "[].namespace"** flag to list just the namespaces of the currently registered providers.

1.  Observe the list of currently registered providers. The **Microsoft.CDN** provider isn't currently in the list of providers.

1.  Use the **az provider register** command with the **--help** flag to get the required flags to register a new provider.

1.  Use the **az provider register** command to register a namespace with your current subscription by using the following setting:

    -   Namespace: **Microsoft.CDN**

1.  Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Task 3: Create a Content Delivery Network profile

1.  Create a new Content Delivery Network profile with the following details:

1.  Copy the value of the **Endpoint hostname** text box. You will use this value later in the lab.

1.  Open a new **Microsoft Edge** browser window.

1.  In the new browser window, go to the **Endpoint hostname** URL for the **cdnweb*[yourname]*** endpoint.

1.  Observe the website and multimedia content that are all served by using Content Delivery Network.

#### Review

In this exercise, you updated your Web App to use Content Delivery Network to serve multimedia content and to serve the web application itself.

### Exercise 5: Clean up your subscription 

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell and list resource groups

1.  In the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than sign (\>) and underscore character (\_).

1.  If this is your first time opening Cloud Shell using your subscription, you can use the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell Wizard** to configure Cloud Shell for first-time usage. Perform the following actions in the wizard:
    
    1.  A dialog box prompts you to create a new storage account to begin using the shell. Accept the default settings, and then select **Create storage**. 

    > **Note**: Wait for Cloud Shell to finish its initial setup procedures before moving forward with the lab. If you don't notice Cloud Shell configuration options, this is most likely because you're using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written with the presumption that you're using a new subscription.

1.  At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt in the portal, enter the following command, and then select Enter to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```
    az group list
    ```
