# Lab: Automate business processes with Logic Apps
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

Your organization keeps a collection of JSON files that it uses to configure third-party products in a Server Message Block (SMB) file share in Microsoft Azure. As part of a regular auditing practice, the operations team would like to call a simple HTTP endpoint and retrieve the current list of configuration files. You have decided to implement this functionality using a no-code solution based on Azure API Management service and Logic Apps.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create a Logic App workflow.

-   Manage products and APIs in a Logic App.

-   Use Azure API Management as a proxy for a Logic App.

## Lab setup

-   Estimated time: **45 minutes**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab virtual machine

Ensure that you're signed in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:
    
-   Username: **Admin**

-   Password: **Pa55w.rd**

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab:

-   Microsoft Edge

-   File Explorer

-   Windows Terminal

### Exercise 1: Create Azure resources

#### Task 1: Open the Azure portal

1.  Sign in to the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>).

1.  If this is your first time signing in to the Azure portal, you'll notice a dialog box offering a tour of the portal. Select **Get Started** to skip the tour.

#### Task 2: Create an API Management resource

1.  In the Azure portal, create a new API Management account with the following details:

    -   New resource group: **AutomatedWorkflow**

    -   Name: **prodapim*[yourname]***

    -   Location: **East US**

    -   Organization name: **Contoso**

    -   Pricing tier: **Consumption (99.9 SLA, %)**

    > **Note**: Wait for Azure to finish creating the API Management resource prior to moving on in the lab. You will receive a notification when the resource is created.

#### Task 3: Create a Logic App resource

1.  In the Azure portal, create a new **logic app** with the following details:
    
    -   Existing resource group: **AutomatedWorkflow**

    -   Name: **prodflow*[yourname]***

    -   Location: **Region - East US**

    -   Log Analytics: **Off**

    > **Note**: Wait for Azure to finish creating the Logic Apps resource prior to moving on in the lab. You will receive a notification when the resource is created.

#### Task 4: Create a storage account

1.  Create a new storage account with the following details:
    
    -   Existing resource group: **AutomatedWorkflow**

    -   Name: **prodstor*[yourname]***

    -   Location: **(US) East US**

    -   Performance: **Standard**

    -   Account kind: **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**

    -   Replication: **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**

    -   Access tier: **Hot**

    > **Note**: Wait for Azure to finish creating the storage account before you move on in the lab. You'll receive a notification when the account is created.

#### Task 5: Upload sample content to Azure Files

1.  Access the **prodstor*[yourname]*** storage account that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  Select the **File shares** link in the **File service** section, and then create a new share with the following settings:
    
    -	Name: **metadata**

    -	Quota: **1** (GiB) 

1.  Select the recently created **metadata** share.
    
1.  In the **metadata** share, select **Upload** to upload the following files in the **Allfiles (F): \\Allfiles\\Labs\\09\\Starter** folder on your lab VM.

    -   **item_00.json**
    
    -   **item_01.json**
    
    -   **item_02.json**
    
    -   **item_03.json**
    
    -   **item_04.json** 

    > **Note**: We recommend that you enable the **Overwrite if files already exist** option.

#### Review

In this exercise, you created all the resources that you'll use for this lab.

### Exercise 2: Implement a workflow using Logic Apps

#### Task 1: Create a trigger for the workflow

1.  Access the **prodflow*[yourname]*** logic app that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  On the **Logic Apps Designer** blade, select the **Blank Logic App** template.

1.  In the **Designer** area, add a new **When a HTTP request is received (Request)** trigger with the following details:

    -   Method: **GET**

#### Task 2: Create an action to query Azure Storage file shares

1.  In the **Designer** area, add a new **List files (Azure File Storage)** action with the following details:

    -   Connection Name: **filesConnection**

    -   Storage Account: **prodstor*[yourname]***
    
    -   Folder: **/metadata**
    
#### Task 3: Create an action to project list item properties

1.  In the **Designer** area, add a new **Select (Data Operations)** action with the following details:

    -   From: **value (List files)**

    -   Map mode: **Text**

    -   Map: **Name (List files)**

#### Task 4: Build an HTTP response action

1.  In the **Designer** area, add a new **Response (Request)** action with the following details:
    
    -   Status Code: **200**
    
    -   Body: **Output (Select)**

1.  **Save** the workflow.

#### Review

In this exercise, you built a basic workflow that starts when it's triggered by an HTTP GET request. It then queries a storage service, enumerates the results, and then returns those results as an HTTP response.

### Exercise 3: Use Azure API Management as a proxy for Logic Apps

#### Task 1: Create a new product

1.  Access the **prodapim*[yourname]*** API Management resource that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  Navigate to the empty list of **Products** for the new account.

    > **Note**: Consumption accounts start without any products.

1.  Add a new product with the following details:

    -   Display name: **Free**

    -   Id: **free** 

    -   Description: **Free tier for anonymous use**

    -   State: **Published**

    -   Requires subscription: **false**

#### Task 2: Create an API integrated with Logic Apps

1.  Navigate to the empty list of **APIs** for the account.

1.  Create a new **Logic App**–integrated API with the following details:

    -   Logic App: **prodflow*[yourname]***
    
    -   Display name: **Metadata Lookup**

    -   Name: **metadata-lookup**

    -   Description: **Look up metadata JSON files**

    -   Products: **Free**

#### Task 3: Test the API operation

1.  Navigate to the **Test** tab for the new API.

1.  On the **Test** tab, perform the following actions:

    1.  Select the single **GET** operation.

    1.  Copy the value of the **Request URL** field. (You will use this value later in the lab.)

    1.  Perform a test request against the operation.

    1.  Observe the JSON results of the test request.

#### Task 4: Validate the end-to-end solution using httprepl

1.  Open the **Windows Terminal** application.

1.  Start the **httprepl** tool, and set the base Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to the value of the **Request URL** for the API operation that you copied earlier in this lab using the following example:

    ```
    httprepl <api-operation-request-url>
    ```

    > **Note**: For example, if your **URL** is **https://prodapimstudent.azure-api.net/manual/paths/invoke**, your command would be **httprepl https://prodapimstudent.azure-api.net/manual/paths/invoke**.

1.  Within the tool prompt, run the **get** command against the API endpoint:

    ```
    get
    ```

1.  Observe the JSON response content of the function app response.

1.  Exit the **httprepl** application:

    ```
    exit
    ```

1.  Close the currently running Windows Terminal application.

1.	Return to your browser window within  Azure portal.

#### Review

In this exercise, you used Azure API Management as a proxy to trigger your Logic App workflow.

### Exercise 4: Clean up your subscription

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell and list resource groups

1.  In the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

1.  In the Azure portal, at the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```
    az group list
    ```

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to get a list of possible commands to delete a resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --help
    ```

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to delete the **AutomatedWorkflow** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name AutomatedWorkflow --no-wait --yes
    ```

1.  Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Task 3: Close the active applications

-   Close the currently running Microsoft Edge application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource groups that were used in this lab.
