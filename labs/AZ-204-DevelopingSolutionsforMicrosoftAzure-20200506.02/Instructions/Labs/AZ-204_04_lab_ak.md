# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes following the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and steps to not match up correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community brings needed changes to our attention. However, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**
