# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community brings needed changes to our attention; however, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

    ```
    httprepl <api-operation-request-url>
    ```

    > **Note**: For example, if your **URL** is **https://prodapimstudent.azure-api.net/manual/paths/invoke**, your command would be **httprepl https://prodapimstudent.azure-api.net/manual/paths/invoke**.

1.  Within the tool prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to run the **get** command against the API endpoint:

    ```
    get

    ```
    az group delete --help
    ```

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to delete the **AutomatedWorkflow** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name AutomatedWorkflow --no-wait --yes
    ```

1.  Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Task 3: Close the active applications

-   Close the currently running Microsoft Edge application.
